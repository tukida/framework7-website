    h2 Open And Close Panel
    p You can control panel state, open and closing it:
    ul
      li using <a href="../docs/panel.html">Panel API</a>
      li by passing `true` or `false` to its `opened` prop
      li by clicking on <a href="link.html">Link</a> or <a href="button.html">Button</a> with relevant `panelOpen` property (to open it) and `panelClose` property to close it
    h2 Access To Panel Instance
    p You can access Panel initialized instance by calling `.instance()` component's method. For example:
    ```svelte
      <Panel bind:this={component}>...</Panel>

      <script>
        let component;

        // to get instance in some method
        component.instance()
      </script>
    ```
