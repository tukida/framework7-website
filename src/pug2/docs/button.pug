    h2 Button Layout
    p Button layout is pretty simple. Just add `button` class to links or submit/button inputs:
    :code(lang="html")
          <!-- link as button -->
          <a class="button">Button</a>

          <!-- <button> as button -->
          <button class="button">Button</button>

          <!-- <input type="submit"> as button -->
          <input type="submit" class="button" value="Button">
    h2 Button Modifier Classes
    p There is a variety of different buttons in Framework7. Different button styles achieved by additional modifier classes and their combinations:

        tr
          td button-raised
          td Raised button
        tr
          td button-raised-ios
          td Raised button in iOS theme only
        tr
          td button-raised-md
          td Raised button in MD theme only
        tr
          td button-raised-aurora
          td Raised button in Aurora theme only
        tr
          td button-outline
          td Outline button
        tr
          td button-outline-ios
          td Outline button in iOS theme only
        tr

        tr
          td button-outline-aurora
          td Outline button in Aurora theme only
        tr
          td button-active
          td Active/selected button state. For use inside of Segmented
        tr
          td button-preloader
          td Should be added to button with preloader to make loading buttons
        tr
          td button-loading
          td Controls button state to show/hide preloader and hide/show button text (switch button to loading state). `button-preloader` should be also added to button
        tr
          td color-[color]
          td Color button, where <b>[color]</b> is one of the <a href="color-themes.html">default colors</a>
    p And of course we can mix these classes:
    :code(lang="html")
          <!-- rounded button -->
          <a class="button button-round">Button</a>

          <!-- rounded and filled button -->
          <a class="button button-round button-fill">Button</a>

          <!-- raised, round, fill, large button -->
          <a class="button button-raised button-round button-fill button-large">Button</a>

          <!-- small red button -->
          <a class="button button-small color-red">Button</a>
    h2 Preloader Button
    p It is possible to create dynamic preloader button. Such button must have Preloader inside and button text wrapped with `<span>` tag, and additional `button-preloader` class:
    ```html
      <button class="button button-preloader">
        <span class="preloader"></span>
        <span>Load</span>
      </button>
    ```
    p And to show preloader we need to add extra `button-loading` class (it will show inner preloader and hide button text):
    ```html
      <button class="button button-preloader button-loading">
        <span class="preloader"></span>
        <span>Load</span>
      </button>
    ```

    h2 Segmented Control
    p A segmented control is a linear set of two or more segments (buttons), each of which functions as a mutually exclusive button. Within the control, all buttons are equal in width. Segmented controls are often used to display different views (switch tabs).
    h3 Segmented Layout
    p Segmented control layout is pretty simple, just a `<div>` with a `segmented` class around buttons:
    :code
      <div class="segmented">
        <a class="button button-active">Tab 1</a>
        <a class="button">Tab 2</a>
      </div>
    p Segmented "strong" requires additional element to correctly indicate active state:
    :code
      <div class="segmented segmented-strong">
        <a class="button button-active">Tab 1</a>
        <a class="button">Tab 2</a>
        <!-- addition element required in segmented strong -->
        <span class="segmented-highlight"></span>
      </div>
    h3 Segmented Modifier Classes
    p As well as buttons, segmented also supports few additional classes for styling:
    table.props-table
      tbody
        tr
          td segmented-round
          td Rounded segmented
        tr
          td segmented-round-ios
          td Rounded segmented in iOS theme
        tr
          td segmented-round-md
          td Rounded segmented in MD theme
        tr
          td segmented-round-aurora
          td Rounded segmented in Aurora theme
        tr
          td segmented-raised
          td Raised segmented
        tr
          td segmented-raised-ios

          td Raised segmented in Aurora theme
