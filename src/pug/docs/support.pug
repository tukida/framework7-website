    h1 Support
    p ZaUI also comes with features detection library.
    p It is available as a `support` property of ZaUI class (`ZaUI.support`) and same property on initialized app instance (`app.support`):
    :code(lang="js")
      // If we need it in place where we don't have access to app instance or before we init the app
      if (!ZaUI.support.touch) {
        console.log('No touch support');
      }


      // After we init the app we can access it as app instance property
      var app = new ZMP({ /*...*/ });

      if (!app.support.touch) {
        console.log('No touch support');
      }

    h2 `getSupport`
    p When we use ZaUI with ES modules, we need to use `getSupport` util instead:
    ```js
      import { getSupport } from 'zmp';

      const support = getSupport();

      if (!support.touch) {
        console.log('No touch support');
      }
    ```
